The first few layers sometimes print poorly. The arms are supposed to be 2 extrusions wide, except that the
"initial layer horizontal expansion" setting might mean the first layer is printed narrower, with
only 1 extrusion. Sometimes the next layer, with normal width, fails to balance on top of this
narrow initial layer. Setting "initial layer horizontal expansion" to zero can help.

But often it prints ok with the default settings.
